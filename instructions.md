## **Features & Functionalities**

### **1. Search Bar (Location Input)**
   - Users can **enter a city name** to get weather updates.
   - Implement **auto-suggestions** as the user types (optional but preferred).

   - Display a **horizontally scrollable** or **grid layout** forecast.
   - Each forecast card includes:
     - **Date & Day**
     - **Expected Temperature (High/Low)**
     - **Weather Icon & Condition**
     - **Precipitation Chances (if available)**

### **4. UI Design & Visual Elements**
   - **Background:** Dynamically change background based on weather conditions:
     - **Sunny:** Light blue gradient background with soft sun rays.

     - **Neutral Colors:** `#F5F5F5` (Light Gray), `#FFFFFF` (White)
   - **Icons:**
     - Use **animated weather icons** from a library like **react-icons**, **LottieFiles**, or **Weather Icons API**.
     - Icons should smoothly transition based on weather changes.
   - **Typography:**
     - **Heading Font:** Poppins or Montserrat (bold, modern)
     - **Body Font:** Inter or Open Sans (clean and readable)
   - **Cards & Buttons:**
     - **Glassmorphism Effect:** Transparent, frosted glass-like weather cards.
     - **Rounded Corners & Soft Shadows:** Smooth, modern feel.

## **Technical Requirements**
- **Framework:** Next.js
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS or CSS-in-JS (Styled Components)
- **API Integration:**
  - Use **fetch() or Axios** to retrieve data from the Weather API.
  - Handle API **loading states**, **error messages**, and **fallback UI**.
- **Responsiveness:** Fully responsive for **mobile**, **tablet**, and **desktop** views.
- **Animations:** Use **Framer Motion** for smooth UI transitions.

## **Expected Output**
- A **React component** (or Vue component) with:
  - **Search bar**, **Current weather section**, **Forecast display**.
  - **Modular, reusable UI components** with clear separation of concerns.
  - **Dynamic styling** that updates based on real-time weather data.
- Code should be **clean, maintainable, and scalab

BACKEND:
## **AI-Powered Forecast Overview (DeepSeek AI Integration)**

### **Objective**
Enhance the weather app by providing an **AI-generated forecast summary** that gives users a more human-like, insightful weather overview. This will summarize trends, highlight significant changes, and offer practical suggestions based on the weather conditions.

---

## **1. Implementation Approach**
- **Retrieve Weather Data** (Current & Forecast) from the Weather API.
- **Format the Weather Data** into a structured prompt for DeepSeek AI.
- **Send the Request** to DeepSeek AI’s API for generating a natural language summary.
- **Display the AI-generated Overview** in the UI.

---

## **2. DeepSeek AI API Integration**
**API Endpoint:**
- DeepSeek AI provides a text-generation API similar to OpenAI’s GPT.
- Example API endpoint:

POST https://api.deepseek.com/v1/completions

**Headers:**
```json
{
"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY",
"Content-Type": "application/json"
}
Request Payload (Example Prompt for Weather Analysis):

    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are a meteorology assistant providing natural-language weather forecasts."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Generate a summary for the following 5-day weather data:\n\n" 
    }
  ],
  "max_tokens": 200,
  "temperature": 0.7
}

        "content": "This week's forecast indicates warm temperatures with scattered showers on Wednesday and Friday. Expect mild winds and a high of 27°C on Thursday. Pack an umbrella for midweek rain!"
      }
    }
  ],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 50,
    "completion_tokens": 30,
    "total_tokens": 80
  }
}
3. UI Implementation
Where to Display: Below the 5-day forecast section, labeled as “AI Weather Insights”.
Design Elements:
Background: Soft gradient or frosted glass effect to blend with the theme.
Typography: Italic or a distinct font to indicate AI-generated content.
Icon: A small AI/robot icon next to the forecast summary.
Loading Animation: Show a placeholder text like "Analyzing forecast trends..." while waiting for AI response.
4. Error Handling & Performance Optimization
Error Handling: If the AI API fails, show a fallback message like:
"AI forecast unavailable. Please check back later."

Caching: Store AI-generated summaries in local state/cache to avoid redundant API calls.
Request Frequency: Limit AI forecast requests to once per user session to reduce API usage.
5. Expected Output
The UI should display an AI-generated text summary that describes trends in weather data.
Example AI-generated text shown in the app:
“Expect sunny skies for most of the week, but a cold front will bring rain and lower temperatures on Thursday and Friday. Winds will be moderate, with a slight increase in humidity by midweek.”
